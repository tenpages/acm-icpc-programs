## [Text Roll](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=618&page=show_problem&problem=4556)
### Description
Take some text. Put a small ball at the top of the letter of the word of the sentence. The ball is drawn via gravity downwards. The text is also at a slight angle, so the ball wants to also move towards the right. The ball can freely move between the lines, and can drop through spaces. Considering the column to be column 1, what column will the ball end up in? In this example, the ball ends up in column 8.

### Idea
Basically simulate the procedure of falling. Notice that positions start at 1 (not 0).
